# HomePriceCalc
This program compares home prices at different lending rates. This program was created in response to increasing home prices due to our low interest rate regime. So, is it worth it to buy the home now at a higher price but at a lower rate? or is it worth it to wait for prices to fall but pay a higher rate? Hopefully, this program can help you answer that.
